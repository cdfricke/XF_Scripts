Double Slit Experiment Scripting Dependencies

To create the geometry and set parameters necessary for the double slit experiment in XFdtd, import the files in this folder to a new project.
Once the files are imported, you can run the DoubleSlitExperiment.xmacro script which will call various other functions that were imported
in order to set up the project for creating simulations.
